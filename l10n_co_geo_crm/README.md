Colombian Geo CRM
=================

This module was written to extend the functionality of DevCO's Colombian Basic Accounting (l10n_co) to support colombian departments and municipalities with their corresponding official codes. It also aims to improve usability in adressfields and helps with disambiguation (ej. Armenia, Quindio vs. Armenia, Antioquia). This is the CRM part of the l10n_co_geo base module.
